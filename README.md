# aesthetic-note-maker
I want pretty notes but I don't know what pretty notes look like so now I have this weird and very buggy WIP thing :dying:

(Note to self so I don't forget) Paste markdown into notes.md and out comes a pdf with the (failed) attempt of making nice notes :skull:
I'll learn how to make aesthetic notes someday trust :sob:

The example here is of some physics notes I took on notion (ignore the fact that they kinda suck). The Waves and Sound folder just has all the images of my physics notes, feel free to delete that lol.
