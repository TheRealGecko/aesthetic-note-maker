# waves and sound 

## Equations

**Frequency =** # of cycles/time (in Hz → 1/s or s^-1)

**Period =** Time to complete 1 cycle → time/# of cycles

**Universal wave equation (2 versions)**

**Sound intensity (dB)** = 10 log((P/A)/(10^-12 W/m^2)) (power per unit area)

## General Definitions

Mechanical wave

- Transfer of energy thru disturbance in a medium
- Come from vibrating source

**Transverse wave**

- Movement perpendicular to rest pos. axis
- E.g: swing

![Untitled](Waves%20and%20Sound%20815c2e42298a475d9219b9ac6a75ba09/Untitled%206.png)

**Longitudinal wave**

- Movement parallel to rest pos. axis
- E.g: spring

![Untitled](Waves%20and%20Sound%20815c2e42298a475d9219b9ac6a75ba09/Untitled%207.png)

Torsional wave

- Object <mark>twists</mark> around rest pos. axis

![Untitled](Waves%20and%20Sound%20815c2e42298a475d9219b9ac6a75ba09/Untitled%208.png)

**Cycle** - 1 pattern of the motion

**Frequency -** # of cycles/time (in Hz → 1/s or s^-1)

**Period -** Time to complete 1 cycle → time/# of cycles

**Amplitude -** Max distance from rest pos.

**Crest/Trough** - Max/min pnt on transverse wave

**Compression/Rarefaction** - Most compressed/uncompressed point longitudinal wave

**Wavelength -** Distance btwn <mark>2 consecutive pnts</mark> in phase (e.g: crest to crest, compression to compression)

**Standing wave**

**Resonance**

**In phase**  - 2 waves same phase shift

**Out of phase -** different phase shifts

**Completely out of phase -** Half-wavelength difference in phase shift

**Vibration** - periodic motion abt a equilib pnt (basically smthing that goes back and forth periodically)

## Interference

**Principle of superposition -**  Displacement of a particle = sum of separate displacements

**Transmission**

- Moving btwn mediums → speed of wave changes
- <mark>Partial reflection</mark> at pnt btwn mediums
- Less dense → more dense = inverted reflection, not inverted transmission
- More dense → less dense = reflection/transmission not inverted
- Speed of wave dependent on medium, elasticity, density, temperature

**Standing wave**

- 2 waves (same wavelength + amplitude) move thru each other → makes pattern of <mark>“stationary”</mark> areas
- **Node** - stationary pnts (areas of deconstructive interference)
    - Occur every 1/2 wavelength
- **Antinode -** crests/troughs (constructive interference)
- Fixed end
    - Nodes at ends
- 1 fixed end
    - Node at one end, antinode in the other
- No fixed ends
    - Antinode at ends, node in middle

**Resonance**

- When interfering wave matches <mark>natural frequency</mark> → forms standing wave → object oscillates with large amplitude

**Damping**

- Decrease in wave amplitude
- E.gs: noise cancellation earphones, shock absorbers (dampen car motion so less rebound on tire springs → car stays in contact with ground)

## Sound

- Longitudinal wave
- Need medium for transmission

Characteristics

- **Pitch -** related to frequency of wave
    - \> frequency = > pitch
    - Below 20 Hz = infrasonic, above 20 kHz = ultrasonic
- **Volume -** related to amplitude
    - \> amp = > sound
- **Quality/Timbre -** most sounds not single frequency, but many tgt

Sound speed

- Solid > liquid > gas
- Warm air > cold air
- Dependant on objects density (K) + elasticity ./(p)

- Mach # = speed of object/speed of sound
    - \> speed of sound = supersonic
    - < speed of sound = subsonic
- Sonic boom → basically just breaking sound barrier too lazy to write more here's a diagram tho

- Echo = reflection of sound
- Loudness (dB) vs sound intensity → loudness = ears response to sound intensity

Beats

- Sound alternating btwn loud/soft bc of interfering waves that r almost same wavelength + frequency

![Untitled](Waves%20and%20Sound%20815c2e42298a475d9219b9ac6a75ba09/Untitled%2011.png)

- Beat frequency = # of max intensity pts per second
    - beat frequency = |wave 1 frequency - wave 2 frequency|

## Doppler effect

- Source generating waves approach observer → frequency sounds like it increases (opposite for moving away)
